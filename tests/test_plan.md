# Test Plan: Event-Driven File Processing with Airflow and MinIO

## 1. Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Event-Driven File Processing system that uses Apache Airflow and MinIO. The system implements automated file detection, compression, and notification features through both local filesystem monitoring and MinIO object storage integration.

## 2. Scope

The testing covers:
- Local file processing workflow
- MinIO file processing workflow
- Email notification system
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance under various conditions
- Integration with external systems

## 3. Test Environment

### Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Airflow environment (webserver, scheduler, PostgreSQL)
- MinIO server
- SMTP server access for emails
- Test files of various types and sizes

### Infrastructure
- Local development environment with Docker
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (optional)

## 4. Test Strategies

### 4.1 Functional Testing
- Verify all workflows operate as expected
- Validate file compression functionality
- Confirm email notifications are sent correctly
- Check proper file organization in directories/buckets

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Test interaction between Airflow and local filesystem
- Test interaction between Airflow and MinIO
- Verify email service integration

### 4.3 Performance Testing
- Measure response time for file detection
- Evaluate system behavior under load (multiple concurrent files)
- Test with various file sizes and types

### 4.4 Error Handling Testing
- Test system behavior with invalid files
- Verify recovery from service failures
- Test with permission issues and network interruptions

## 6. Resources

- Test Team: 2 QA engineers
- Development Team: 2 developers for bug fixes
- Infrastructure: Docker environment with sufficient resources
- Test Data: Various file types (text, PDF, images) of different sizes

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Docker container failures | High | Implement container health checks and auto-restart policies |
| Email service unavailability | Medium | Create mock email service for testing |
| Large file handling issues | Medium | Gradual testing with incrementally larger files |
| MinIO performance limitations | Medium | Configure appropriate resource limits and test with realistic loads |
